# BSAN-6070-CA06-kNNRecommender

This repository houses my project for CA06 kNN Movie Recommendation Model using k Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

In this Computer Assignment we create a kNN model to group together similar movies given certain input features and give out recommendation based on the datapoints closest to the given input features. We have chose the k-value of 5 so the algorithm the top 5 most recommended movies closest to the input features provided. This ia similar approach that streaming services like Netflix will use when providing show recommendations to users who have watched certain shows.
